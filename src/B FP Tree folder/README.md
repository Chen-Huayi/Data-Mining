# FP Tree  

Part of the codes from open source [link](https://github.com/baiyyang/FP-growth)  

There are 2 java files for the codes. You can run it by IDE or command line.  
If run in IDE, just open both files in IDE, then compile and run.  
If run by command line. Use javac to compile FPTree.java and then run java FPTree.  
Make sure the input file is always in the same folder of the source code files.  

When we dealt with the data, we have several input files. To avoid huge size of appendix files, here is just a example.
