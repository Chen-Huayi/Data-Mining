# Online Retail Transaction Example
The [video](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AhfQkpeGM2gdgv9Qxj5MsS22aOgzNg?e=9d7IJx) of *Presentation.pptx* briefly introduces this data mining processes.  
The [Implementation.pdf](https://github.com/Chen-Huayi/Data-Mining/blob/main/Implementation.pdf) detailedly illustrates how we apply algorithms from data mining in a simple case.
